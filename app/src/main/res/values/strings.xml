Various subjects in Science, Humanities and Commerce are taught at the undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) levels apart from some non-traditional and career oriented subjects. PG courses are offered in Bengali, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science. Non-traditional courses are offered in Microbiology, Biotechnology, Computer Science and Computer Applications. Teachers’ Training courses (B.Ed.) and Training in Physical Education (B.P.Ed.) are also two important directions at this Institution.
